# Description

Basic framework for the segregation paper. Start with a simple example in Richmond.

## Distance (travel time) calculations

```{r dists.richmond}
dists.richmond <- funDists.richmond()
```

## Census In


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
